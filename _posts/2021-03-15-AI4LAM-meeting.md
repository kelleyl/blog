I will present about the work we have done developing an annotated corpus of slate frames and the results of training a text component detection model. The slate frames were annotated using the VIA (VGG Image Annotator) tool.
During the talk I will walk through how we configured the annotation environment and present intial results evaluating existing CLAMS tools on this dataset.
