    abstract = "We present Computational Linguistics Applications for Multimedia Services (CLAMS), a platform that provides access to computational content analysis tools for archival multimedia material that appear in different media, such as text, audio, image, and video. The primary goal of CLAMS is: (1) to develop an interchange format between multimodal metadata generation tools to ensure interoperability between tools; (2) to provide users with a portable, user-friendly workflow engine to chain selected tools to extract meaningful analyses; and (3) to create a public software development kit (SDK) for developers that eases deployment of analysis tools within the CLAMS platform. CLAMS is designed to help archives and libraries enrich the metadata associated with their mass-digitized multimedia collections, that would otherwise be largely unsearchable.",

In this paper, wediscuss the enhanced data visualization capabilities that are also enabled by inter-operating NLP pipelines and interchange formats.For adding openly available visualization tools and graphical annotation tools to the Language Applications Grid (LAPPS Grid) andComputational Linguistics Applications for Multimedia Services (CLAMS) toolboxes, we have developed interchange formats that cancarry annotations and metadata for text and audiovisual source data. We descibe those data formats and present case studies where wesuccessfully adopt open-source visualization tools and combine them with CL tools.",

In this paper we describe an attempt to reproduce the methods and resultsfrom the top performing system at for SemEval-2018 Task 7. We describe challenges we encountered in the process, report on the resultsof our system, and discuss the ways that our attempt at reproduction can inform best practices.",
